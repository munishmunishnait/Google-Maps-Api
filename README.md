# Google-Maps-Api

# Overview
This project showcases the use of the Google Maps JavaScript API for educational purposes. It involves two main tasks, each with specific requirements:

# Task 1: Google Maps Basics

1. Create a web page with two different maps of various locations.
- The page should include text content and styling.
- Maps should feature:
1. Styled link to load each map (one automatically loads on page load).
2. One map with controls removed.
3. One roadmap and another map type.
4. At least two different shapes (e.g., circle, rectangle, polygon).
5. At least two markers, each with an infowindow.
6. One marker should have a well-designed infowindow displayed by default.
7. Another marker should have a custom icon.
8. Each infowindow should contain an image.
   
# Task 2 (Choose one):

Option 1: Geocode Challenge - API Key

1. Dynamically plot locations from a database on a Google Map using geocoded addresses.
2. Display a map centered on the address with a marker titled with the company's name.
3. You can choose to plot each address individually or display all companies on a single map.
   
Option 2: Overlay Click - No API Key Required

1. Create a well-styled web page with a Google map featuring overlays, including markers with custom icons and shapes.
2. Add event listeners to overlays to change content in a <div> on the page.
3. Ensure content in the divs describes the locations marked by overlays.
